This repo shows us how to compute similarity between two documents. Document 1 can be a query and document 2 can be a list of other documents.

1. Extract the file from the squad_train_doc.json folder.
2. Load the JSON file.
3. Run the model and implement the model.
4. Input your question from any of the documents, using list_questions_per_doc[index].
5. Compute the dataframe.
6. Compare the results.
